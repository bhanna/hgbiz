	<div class="span6 offset3"><p dir="ltr"><strong>Why would I choose a subscription? Can’t I just call a lawyer when I need one?</strong></p>
		<p dir="ltr">By working with HG regularly, you’ll have lawyers at-hand who already know your business and can help you avoid common pitfalls before you end up in a situation that requires expensive legal services to fix.</p>
		<p dir="ltr">More generally, we offer subscriptions because they allow us to offer our clients:</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>Readily accessible service</li>
			<li>Personalized advice</li>
			<li>Proactive planning and risk mitigation</li>
			<li>Low, predictable costs and lower long-term costs</li>
		</ul>
		&nbsp;
		<p dir="ltr"><strong>What do my on-call legal service hours include?</strong></p>
		<p dir="ltr">Your on-call legal service hours include business strategy planning, marketing strategy planning, document review, legal research, referral services, negotiation, sending cease and desist letters, and a variety of other legal and business services(link to services page).  It does not include time-intensive services such as document-writing (e.g. employee handbooks, contracts, partnership agreements) or litigation.</p>
		&nbsp;
		<p dir="ltr"><strong>But I want you to write a document for me.</strong></p>
		<p dir="ltr">Document writing is not included in your monthly subscription.  However, if you commit to a six month subscription, we will throw in one free document.  If you commit to one year, we will include three free documents.</p>
		&nbsp;
		<p dir="ltr"><strong>What happens if I go over my number of questions or hours? What are your hourly rates?</strong></p>
		<p dir="ltr">To make sure you never unknowingly exceed that month’s hours/questions, HG will notify you in advance whenever you are close to meeting that month’s allotment.  If you find you’ll need additional legal hours that month, you’ll have the option to either upgrade to the next subscription level or pay hourly for additional unbundled services.</p>
		&nbsp;
		
		<strong>Can my employees ask questions using my subscription?</strong>
		<p dir="ltr">Because of potential conflicts of interest, HG cannot enter a lawyer-client relationship with both your company and your employees.  We therefore cannot give legal advice to your employees through your company’s subscription package.  However, HG will gladly work with your company to create and provide an Employee Assistance Program to your employees to provide them with their own legal services.  For more information about our EAP bundles and rates, please contact us at <a href="mailto:info@hgbusinesslaw.com">info@hgbusinesslaw.com</a>.</p>
